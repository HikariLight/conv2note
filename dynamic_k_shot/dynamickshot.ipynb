He notes that he has been very lightheaded. He denies any hematochezia. The patient does note some decrease in appetite. The patient reports some nausea when he is sitting in the back of the car. He denies any abdominal pain, fever, chills, vomiting, or recent weight loss. The patient also denies night sweats, or a cough.\\n\\nThe patient notes that he is doing well status post knee arthroplasty. He is walking around without any problems.\\n\\nThe patient had a biopsy a few years ago for potential lung cancer, however the nodule was benign. He is doing well.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\\n\\n• Constitutional: No fevers, chills, or weight loss.\\n• Gastrointestinal: Endorses decreased appetite and mild nausea. Denies hematochezia.\\n• Neurological: Endorse lightheadedness.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\n\\n• Constitutional: in no apparent distress.\\n• Neck: Supple without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.\\n• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.\\n• Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds.\\n• Gastrointestinal: Right lower quadrant tender to palpation.\\n• Musculoskeletal: No lower extremity edema\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nHemoglobin- 8.2, which is low for his height and weight.\\n\\nEndoscopy from the emergency room showed gastritis and a slight polyp. The biopsy results are still pending.\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\\n\\nVincent Young is a 56-year-old male who presents today for lab review.\\n\\nNew found anemia.\\n• Medical Reasoning: His hemoglobin was 8.2, which is low for his height and weight. Endoscopy from the hospital showed gastritis which could be the source of bleeding. The endoscopy also showed a polyp and a polypectomy was performed. The pathology is still pending.\\n• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to reduce his caffeine consumption avoid NSAIDs and alcohol.\\n• Additional Testing: Repeat CBC was ordered.\\n• Medical Treatment: I prescribed Protonix 40 mg once a day for gastritis.\\n\\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\\n'}, references=None, vector={}, collection='Reports'), Object(uuid=_WeaviateUUIDInt('c88c9e88-8e72-473e-91e7-e16fa4068157'), metadata=MetadataReturn(creation_time=None, last_update_time=None, distance=None, certainty=None, score=None, explain_score=None, is_consistent=None, rerank_score=None), properties={'summary': 'CHIEF COMPLAINT\\n\\nFollow-up from an emergency room visit.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\\n\\nLouis Williams is a 58-year-old male presenting for a follow-up from an emergency room visit.\\n\\nThe patient states that he was playing tennis on Saturday, that he was really hot and that after approximately 30 minutes he was struggling to breathe. He states that he thought he was having a heart attack at that time. His wife took him to the emergency room and at that time, he states that he had been feeling very lightheaded and dizzy. He notes that on Sunday he felt fine.\\n\\nThe patient reports that he has been very diligent with his medications for his congestive heart failure.

I will also place him on carvedilol 25 mg twice a day.\\n\\nStatus post basal cell carcinoma removal.\\n• Medical Reasoning: He seems to be doing well and the removal site is well-healed.

      "[doctor] turned out to be benign .\n",
      "[patient] yup .\n",
      "[doctor] okay . great . all right . well , let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam . so looking at you , you do n't appear in any distress . your heart is regular . your lungs sound nice and clear . you have some tenderness to the right lower quadrant to palpation of your abdomen . your lower extremities have no edema .\n",
      "[doctor] um , all right . well , let's go ahead and look at your labs , okay ?\n",
      "[patient] yup .\n",
      "[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin . yeah , so your hemoglobin is 8.2 , which is quite low for somebody of your height and weight , so we'll have to look into that a , a little bit further . i know that they did the endoscopy in the emergency room . hey , dragon , show me the endoscope results .\n",
      "[doctor] good . so it looks like you had some gastritis , which is just inflammation of your stomach and they also found a slight polyp , which i know that they biopsied and the results are pending at this time . um , so , you may have had some bleeding from the gastritis . it's not usual for people to have bleeding from that .\n",
      "[doctor] um , okay , well , hey , dragon , show me the anemia panel . okay .\n",
      "[doctor] anyway , okay . well , vincent , i think , you know , in terms of , my impression of you is that you've had this newfound anemia and for that , i think that we should go ahead and put you on protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day to help with the gastritis . does that sound okay to you ?\n",
      "[patient] it does . you're the doctor . i do n't know what it is .\n",
      "[doctor] so that's just , uh , what we call a proton pump inhibitor which , uh , helps decrease the amount of acid secreted within your stomach .\n",
      "[patient] got it . makes sense .\n",
      "[doctor] hey , hey , dragon , order protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day .\n",
      "[doctor] and i'd like you to try to cut down on your caffeine 'cause that can also irritate your stomach . try not to take any ibuprofen and try to cut down on any alcohol intake , okay ?\n",
